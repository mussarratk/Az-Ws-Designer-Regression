## Train and Deploy a Predictive Models
## Train a regression model. Use a Regression Model. Deploy a model as a webservice. Create a real-time inference pipeline


* Azure Machine Learning includes an automated machine learning capability that leverages the scalability of cloud compute to automatically try multiple pre-processing techniques and model-training algorithms in parallel to find the best performing supervised machine learning model for your data.
* Regression is an example of a **supervised** machine learning technique in which you train a model **to predict a numeric label **based on an item's features. 

- The metric score threshold causes the experiment to end if a model achieves a certain score (or less) on normalized root mean squared error.

- Create a real-time inference pipeline with Kubernetes Clusters for** Production**
- An inference pipeline will form the basis for a predictive service that you can publish for applications to use.
- Azure Container Instance for Compute type in the real-time endpoint setting box. (ACI) is used for **testing or development.**
